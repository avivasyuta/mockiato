# Mockiato

> Mocks on the Fly!

Mockiato is a powerful and easy-to-use browser extension designed for developers and testers working with Google Chrome
or other Chromium-based browsers.
It enables users to effortlessly mock HTTP requests, modify responses, and simulate various network conditions.
With Mockiato, you can create different testing scenarios, such as long response times, error states, or missing data,
and all of this can be controlled through a sleek, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Response Customization**: Define custom response bodies and status codes for different HTTP requests. This is ideal
  for testing different scenarios, including success, error states, and partial responses.
- **Delay Responses**: Introduce artificial delays to simulate slow responses and test how your application handles different
loading states.
- **Header Management**: Customize request and response headers effortlessly. You can also create different header profiles
for various environments, such as development, staging, and production, making it easy to switch configurations based on
your testing needs.
**DevTools Integration**: Mockiato integrates seamlessly with Chrome's Developer Tools, adding itself as a tab in the
DevTools panel. From this tab, you can easily view network logs, create and manage mocks, and monitor requests in real
time.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Mockiato features a sleek, intuitive UI that makes setting up and managing mocks simple, even
for those new to testing. All configurations can be managed visually, without any need for complex scripting.

## Use Cases

- **Test Edge Cases**: Simulate slow-loading requests, incorrect data, or error statuses to see how your application behaves
in real-world scenarios.
- **Environment-Based Testing**: Create profiles for different environments, such as development, staging, and production, to
switch between setups easily.
- **API Response Testing**: Mock different types of API responses, such as success, errors, or empty payloads, without having
to rely on the actual backend or making modifications to it.
